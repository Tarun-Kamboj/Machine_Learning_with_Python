## Introduction

`Recommender systems` are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders.

Recommender systems usually make use of either or both `collaborative filtering` and `content-based filtering`. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in. Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.

In the [Notebook](Notebook.ipynb), we learn how to implement Content Based Filtering Recommendation System.
